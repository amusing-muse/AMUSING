AMUSING sample characterisation:


***************************************
*****            TABLES           *****
***************************************

A) NED:

I use the tool to Build Data Table from Input List (Near Position, Cross-Matching option). In the query I include all the information I consider could be of interest. You can find two different tables:

- NED_notes.csv: In this table I look for all the objects within a 10'' radius with respect to the original coordinates of each object. In this table I show some notes, aspects regarding the search (separation of each object from the original coordinates), the object name (I need this infor for the Hyperleda search) and J2000 coordinates. In addition I have done a cross-match with the "amusing name" (the name according to the table you sent me). All the columns are as follows:

Row_1 --> Just a number identifying the row.
Notes regarding Input Position --> Notes from NED
Input Position (RA) --> Input Position (RA) from AMUSING table
Input Position (DEC) --> Input Position (DEC) from AMUSING table
Sep ('') --> Separation in arcsecs from this particular entry to the input position.
Essential Note --> Notes from NED
Object Name --> Object name according to NED
Amusing Name --> Object name according to AMUSING table
amusing redshift --> Redshift according to AMUSING table
RA (J2000) --> RA according to NED to this particular entry
Dec (J2000) --> DEC according to NED to this particular entry
Row_1a --> Just a number identifying the row.

- NED_detailed_info.csv: In this table I show essencially the same table as before (same number of rows) but in this case I extract all the information from NED that I consider interesting (galactic extinction, object type, redshift, magnitude, major and minor diameters, morphology, and distance). All the columns are as follows:

Row --> Just a number identifying the row.
Object Name  --> NED name
RA (J2000)  -->  RA from NED
Dec (J2000)  -->  DEC from NED
Galactic Extinction SDSS-u (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag]  -->  Galactic Extinction SDSS-u (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag] from NED
Galactic Extinction SDSS-g (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag]  -->  Galactic Extinction SDSS-g (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag] from NED
Galactic Extinction SDSS-r (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag]  -->  Galactic Extinction SDSS-r (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag] from NED
Galactic Extinction SDSS-i (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag]  -->  Galactic Extinction SDSS-i (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag] from NED
Galactic Extinction SDSS-z (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag]  -->  Galactic Extinction SDSS-z (Schlafly etal. 2011) [mag] from NED
Object type  -->  Object type from NED
cz (km/s)  --> As indicated obtained from NED
Redshift  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Redshift uncertainty   -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Redshift quality flat  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
quick look magnitude  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Major Diam (arcmin)  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Minor Diam (arcmin)  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Morph./Description  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Dist. Mod. Mean (mag)  -->  As indicated obtained from NED
Metric Dist. Mean (kpc)  --> As indicated obtained from NED
Row --> Just a number identifying the row.

Once I have all this information (i.e. for each galaxy in amusing all the objects according to NED within a radius of 10'') I am going to decide the best designation (name) for each galaxy. For doing that I cross-check a table with the names and coordinates of the AMUSING galaxies and with the output from the NED query (the definitive names are in 'AMUSING_SAMPLE_definitive_names.txt'). For the hyperleda query I need names, that's why I do that.

B) Hyperleda:

And now I compile all the available information for the AMUSING sample of galaxies using hyperleda. In 'amusing_sample_char_updated.csv' I join such table (all the information from hyperleda) with the initial table (original names and coordinates of the AMUSING sample). In addition, just to compare if what hyperleda and myself have done is correct, I compute the difference (in arcsecs) between the position (RA and DEC) of the original targets and the sources for which I have information. All the columns are as follows:

Amusing Name --> The name according to the original AMUSING table
RA_amusing --> RA according to the original AMUSING table
DEC_amusing --> DEC according to the original AMUSING table
RA_degrees_amusing --> RA according to the original AMUSING table (degrees)
DEC_degrees_amusing --> DEC according to the original AMUSING table (degrees)
zz_amusing --> redshift according to the original AMUSING table
def_name --> definitive name (as explained before)
SN_name --> Name of the SN linked to this obeject
pgc --> PGC designation (according to hyperleda)
hyperleda_name --> Hyperleda name
other_names(pgc) --> Other designations
objtype --> type of object 
RA_hours_hyperleda --> RA according to hyperleda (hours)
RA_degrees_hyperleda --> RA according to hyperleda (degrees)
DEC_degrees_hyperleda --> DEC according to hyperleda (degrees)
Delta_RA(arcsec) --> (RA_degrees_amusing - RA_degrees_hyperleda)*360.0
Delta_dec(arcsec) --> (DEC_degrees_amusing - DEC_degrees_hyperleda)*360.0
l2 --> galactic longitude (degrees)

Although all this information might be important to characterise the AMUSING sample, in my case (and I guess that this applies to everyone) having optical images to see how they look like and play with the data (obtain surface brightness profiles, ellipticity and position angle of the disc, etc.) is crucial.

A) SDSS: I cross-check the AMUSING sample with SDSS database and I obtain 20 galaxies in common. I download colour images for visualization purposes. To download photometric and spectroscopic data use SDSS_query.py.

B) Carnegie-Irvine survey: I did the same with the sample from the Carnegie-Irvine survey (https://cgs.obs.carnegiescience.edu/CGS/Home.html). The AMUSING sample and this survey have 12 galaxies in common. All the information from that survey (analysis of the light distribution, masses, colour profiles, etc etc...) can be downloaded for those galaxies in the survey's webpage.

C) DSS: I have downloaded all the fits files for the 197 galaxies in AMUSING using the red bands (I am having problems downloading the blue bands, in DSS_query.py replace 'red' by 'blue' and change the size if needed, by changing the input table you can also centre the objects in the fits files) with two different fields of view (5'x5' and 15'x15'). With all these data we can further characterise the sample. I have created also some png files (see folder named images) for a quicker visualization of the galaxies.
